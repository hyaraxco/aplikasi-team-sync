# Project Overview

This project, named Team Sync, is a web app for managing projects, tasks, teams, attendance, and payroll. The system uses Firebase (Firestore + Auth), supports Admin and User roles, and shares UI components across roles. Payroll is calculated based on completed tasks and daily check-in/check-out logs.is built using Next.js and TypeScript. It integrates various libraries for state management, UI components, and data fetching.

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, adhering to the defined color palette.

# Important Scripts

- `dev`: Starts the development server.
- `build`: Builds the application for production.

# AI Interaction Guidelines

- When generating code, prioritize TypeScript and React best practices.
- Ensure that any new components are reusable and follow the existing design patterns.
- Minimize the use of AI generated comments, instead use clearly named variables and functions.
- Always validate user inputs and handle errors gracefully.
- Use the existing components and pages as a reference for the new components and pages.
- Use the existing state management and data fetching logic as a reference for new features.
- Ensure that the generated code is compatible with the existing codebase.
- Ensure the page is responsive and accessible.
- Ensure optimize the page for performance.
